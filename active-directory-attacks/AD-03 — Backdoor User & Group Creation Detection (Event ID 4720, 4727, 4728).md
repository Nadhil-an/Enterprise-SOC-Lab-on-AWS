## 📋 Executive Summary

An attacker persistence and privilege escalation scenario was simulated inside an Active Directory domain environment. Using PowerShell with Administrator privileges on the Domain Controller, a backdoor user account (`hacker`) was created, a new security group (`IT-Support`) was provisioned, and the backdoor user was added to the group — mirroring real-world post-compromise persistence techniques. These three actions generated Event ID 4720 (User Account Created), Event ID 4727 (Security Group Created), and Event ID 4728 (Member Added to Group) in Windows Security logs. Splunk SIEM successfully detected all three events, enabling full reconstruction of the attacker's account manipulation chain. This lab demonstrates end-to-end detection capability for persistence and privilege escalation techniques in a domain environment.

## 🔴 Attack Simulation

### Phase 1 — Create Backdoor User Account (Event ID 4720)

With Administrator access on the Domain Controller, PowerShell was used to create a new user account — simulating an attacker establishing a persistent backdoor identity in the domain.

```powershell
$pass = Read-Host "Enter Password" -AsSecureString

New-ADUser -Name "hacker" `
           -SamAccountName "hacker" `
           -UserPrincipalName "hacker@soc.local" `
           -Path "CN=Users,DC=soc,DC=local" `
           -AccountPassword $pass `
           -Enabled $true
```

Account creation was verified immediately:

```powershell
Get-ADUser -Identity hacker
```

Each successful user creation generates the following in Windows Security logs:

```
Event ID  : 4720
Log Source: Security
Category  : Account Management
Message   : A user account was created
```

</p>

### Phase 2 — Create Security Group (Event ID 4727)

A new domain security group was created — simulating an attacker provisioning a custom group to assign privileges without drawing attention to existing privileged groups.

```powershell
New-ADGroup -Name "IT-Support" `
            -SamAccountName "IT-Support" `
            -GroupScope Global `
            -GroupCategory Security `
            -Path "CN=Users,DC=soc,DC=local"
```

Group creation was verified:

```powershell
Get-ADGroup "IT-Support"
```

This generates the following event:

```
Event ID  : 4727
Log Source: Security
Category  : Account Management
Message   : A security-enabled global group was created
```

</p>

---

### Phase 3 — Add Backdoor User to Group (Event ID 4728)

The backdoor user was added to the newly created group — completing the privilege assignment step of the persistence chain.

```powershell
Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "IT-Support" -Members "hacker"
```

This generates the following event:

```
Event ID  : 4728
Log Source: Security
Category  : Account Management
Message   : A member was added to a security-enabled global group
```

## 🗺️ MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

| Tactic | Technique | ID | Observation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Persistence | Create Account — Domain Account | T1136.002 | Backdoor user `hacker` created in domain |
| Privilege Escalation | Account Manipulation | T1098 | User added to security group for elevated access |
| Privilege Escalation | Valid Accounts | T1078.002 | Leveraging Administrator account to provision access |
| Defense Evasion | Account Manipulation | T1098 | Creating new group instead of using visible privileged groups |

## ⚠️ Risk Assessment

| Factor | Value |
|---|---|
| Attack Type | Persistence & Privilege Escalation |
| Method | PowerShell AD cmdlets (native tooling — low noise) |
| Detection Events | 4720, 4727, 4728 |
| Severity | **High** |
| Impact | Persistent domain access via backdoor account |
| Lateral Movement Risk | High — domain user with group membership can access resources |
| Data Exposure Risk | High — depends on group privileges assigned |
| Stealth Level | Medium — uses legitimate admin tools (Living off the Land) |

**Why this is critical:**
- Attackers use built-in PowerShell AD cmdlets — no malware, no external tools
- Backdoor accounts survive password resets on other accounts
- New groups are less monitored than changes to existing privileged groups (Domain Admins)
- If `IT-Support` is later granted elevated permissions, the backdoor escalates silently

## 🛡️ SOC Analyst Investigation Checklist

When Event ID 4720, 4727, or 4728 is detected, a SOC analyst should:

- [ ] Identify who created the account/group — was it an authorized IT admin?
- [ ] Check if creation occurred during business hours or a known provisioning window
- [ ] Verify whether the new account appears in the HR/IT provisioning ticket system
- [ ] Inspect the account name — generic or suspicious names (e.g. `svc_`, `admin2`, `hacker`)
- [ ] Check what group the user was added to — is it a privileged group?
- [ ] Correlate 4720 → 4727 → 4728 from the same SubjectUserName within a short window
- [ ] Query for any logon events (4624) from the new account after creation
- [ ] Check if the new account has been used for lateral movement (Event ID 4648, 4672)
- [ ] Disable and isolate the suspicious account immediately if unauthorized
- [ ] Remove the account from any groups it was assigned to
- [ ] Escalate to Tier 2 if privileged group membership or domain admin involvement confirmed

| Alert on any addition to Domain Admins / Administrators group | 🔴 Immediate |
| Restrict AD user/group creation to dedicated service accounts only | 🟠 High |
| Implement Just-In-Time (JIT) privileged access for admin tasks | 🟠 High |
| Enable PowerShell Script Block Logging to capture cmdlet usage | 🟠 High |
| Regular audit of AD users and groups for unauthorized accounts | 🟡 Medium |
| Integrate AD provisioning with ticketing system for baseline comparison | 🟡 Medium |

---

## 🧹 Lab Cleanup

After completing the simulation, remove the test objects:

```powershell
# Remove backdoor user
Remove-ADUser -Identity "hacker" -Confirm:$false

# Remove security group
Remove-ADGroup -Identity "IT-Support" -Confirm:$false
```

Verify removal:

```powershell
Get-ADUser -Identity hacker    # Should return error — user not found
Get-ADGroup -Identity IT-Support  # Should return error — group not found
```

## 🧾 Investigation Summary

An attacker persistence chain was simulated on the Active Directory Domain Controller using native PowerShell AD cmdlets under a compromised Administrator account. Three sequential actions were performed: creation of a backdoor user account (`hacker`), creation of a new security group (`IT-Support`), and assignment of the backdoor user to that group — generating Event ID 4720, 4727, and 4728 respectively in Windows Security logs.

Splunk SIEM detected all three events independently via targeted SPL queries and confirmed the attacker's identity (SubjectUserName), the affected objects, and the full timeline of the manipulation chain. Correlation of all three events within a short timeframe from the same actor provides high-confidence detection of the persistence and privilege escalation pattern.

This simulation demonstrates that Living-off-the-Land techniques using native AD tooling generate clear, detectable audit events — validating the importance of monitoring Account Management event categories in any enterprise SOC.

**Lab Status:** ✅ User Created → ✅ Group Created → ✅ Member Added → ✅ All Events Detected in Splunk → ✅ Full Chain Investigated
